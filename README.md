# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Introduction :

Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in today’s society.

The early diagnosis of BC can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, the correct diagnosis of BC and classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research. Because of its unique advantages in critical features detection from complex BC datasets, machine learning (ML) is widely recognized as the methodology of choice in BC pattern classification and forecast modelling.

Classification and data mining methods are an effective way to classify data. Especially in medical field, where those methods are widely used in diagnosis and analysis to make decisions. 

Dataset:

The machine learning algorithms were trained to detect breast cancer using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. According to the dataset consists of features which were computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The said features describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei found in the image.

There are 569 data points in the dataset: 212 –Malignant, 357 Benign. Accordingly, the dataset features are as follows: (1) radius, (2)texture,(3)perimeter,(4)area,(5)smoothness,(6)compactness,(7)concavity,(8)concavepoints,(9)symmetry,and (10) fractaldimension.With each feature having three information:(1)mean,(2)standarderror,and(3)“worst”orlargest(mean of the three largest values) computed. Thus, having a total of 30 dataset features.

Objectives : 

This analysis aims to observe which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to see general trends that may aid us in model selection and hyper parameter selection. The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant. To achieve this i have used machine learning classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input.
